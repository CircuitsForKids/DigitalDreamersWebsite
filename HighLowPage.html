            <h2>Welcome to the High vs. Low lesson</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the High vs. Low Signals game!
                <br>
                <br>This game will help remind you the difference between a high or a low signal. Consider the top half of the screen a high signal (or a 1), 
                and consider the bottom half to be a low signal (0). When the lightbulb is on the top half of the screen, it turns on to show you that when
                the signal is high (1) then it turns on the circuit, powering the lightbulb. To the opposite, when the lightbulb is on the bottom half 
                of the screen it turns off to show that when the signal is low (0) it turns off the circuit, turning off the circuit.
                <br>
                <br>The objective of the game is simple: move the lightbulb up and down to try to go in between as much batteries as you can.
                <br>
                <br>Game Instructions:
                <br>Press the play button to begin playing the game.
                <br>Hold the Up arrow button on your keyboard to move the lightbulb up on the screen.
                <br>Hold the Down arrow button on your keyboard to move the lightbulb down on the screen.
                <br>
                <br>Try to get the highest score you can!</p>
